sometimes 

the ceiling drops down on Him

getting 

progressively 

lower

and

lower
---
until it begins to graze his head, only to shift a few minutes later
----
rising

higher

and 

higher

until

---

it disappears altogether

---

sometimes

the hallway

widens

until at one 

point

HE

swears he 

is moving

down

some

enourmous

plateau
